# chicken-nuggets

A simple python script that calculates the solution to the coin problem (or chicken nugget problem) in which one is given a series of coin values and is told to calculate the largest value that cannot be formed with said coin values, if any.

The function takes a tuple/list of values and returns the largest value that cannot be formed with said values, -1 if said value does not exist (ie. with values 2 and 4, there is no largest value that cannot be formed) or 0 if all values can be made.
